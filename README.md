# VoltSec-Cloud-Connect
VoltSec Cloud-Connect is an innovative project designed to seamlessly integrate VoltSec.io's cutting-edge threat intelligence with leading cloud security platforms, empowering organizations to fortify their cloud environments with proactive security measures. This project enables real-time monitoring and incident response automation.


## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive real-time security monitoring and user management system that enables organizations to effectively monitor and manage security events, user access, and system configurations.

### Key Features

* **Real-time Security Monitoring:**
    * Collects and analyzes security events from various sources in real-time.
    * Identifies and prioritizes security incidents based on severity and potential impact.
    * Triggers alerts and notifications to relevant personnel for timely response.

* **User Management:**
    * Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions to enforce granular access control.
    * Implements secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user credentials.
    * Provides a user API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.

## Components

The system consists of the following key components:

* **Event Aggregator:**
    * Collects events from multiple sources, such as syslog servers, API logs, and security event logs.
    * Aggregates events into a unified format for consistent analysis and storage.
    * Stores aggregated events in a central location, such as a Kafka topic.

* **Alert Processor:**
    * Processes aggregated events to identify and prioritize security incidents.
    * Generates alerts based on event type, severity, and other relevant factors.
    * Notifies relevant personnel about alerts and initiates remediation actions.

* **Access Control Manager:**
    * Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to control user access to resources and actions.
    * Checks permissions for each user based on their assigned roles.
    * Provides a mechanism for granting or revoking permissions for specific roles.

* **User Authentication Manager:**
    * Handles user authentication using secure password hashing and verification mechanisms.
    * Manages session tokens to maintain user authentication across requests.
    * Provides a method for validating session tokens to ensure valid user access.

## Implementation

The system is implemented using a combination of Python libraries and frameworks, including:

* Flask: Web framework for building RESTful APIs
* Kafka: Distributed streaming platform for event processing
* SQLAlchemy: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for database access
* Hashlib: Secure hashing library for password protection

## Usage

To run the system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Start the Kafka brokers:
    ```bash
    kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

3. Start the event aggregator:
    ```bash
    python event_aggregator.py
    ```

4. Start the alert processor:
    ```bash
    python alert_processor.py
    ```

5. Start the user API server:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    

## Deployment

The system can be deployed on a production environment using various methods, such as:

* Docker containers for isolated and portable deployment
* Cloud platforms, such as AWS or Azure, for scalable and managed deployment
* On-premises servers for customized configuration and control
